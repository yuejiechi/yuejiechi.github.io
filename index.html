<p><br> </p>  
<p>I am the Sense of Wonder Group Endowed Professor of <a href="http://ece.cmu.edu">Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> in AI Systems</a> at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I am also an affiliated faculty member with the <a href="http://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department</a> and <a href="https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/">CyLab</a>. My department homepage is <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/chi-yuejie.html">here</a>. 

<p>My research interests lie in the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of data science, machine learning, signal processing and inverse problems, with applications in sensing, imaging, decision making, and AI systems, broadly defined. The problems my group studies are often interdisciplinary in nature, lying at the intersection of statistics, learning, optimization, and sensing. My current focus is on improving the efficiency and reliability of generative AI and reinforcement learning, driven by data-intensive but resource-constrained applications in science and engineering. Specific lines of research topics can be found <a href="research.html">here</a>.
 
<p>I have been lucky to receive a couple of awards for my work, including Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) from the White House, the highest honor bestowed by the United States Government to outstanding early-career scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise for leadership in science and technology. In 2019, I received the <i>inaugural</i> IEEE Signal Processing Society Early Career Technical Achievement Award for contributions to high-dimensional structured signal processing. In addition, I received <a href="https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/may-prize-spotlight#Chen-et-al">SIAM Activity Group on Imaging Science Best Paper Prize</a>, IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and young investigator awards from several agencies including NSF, ONR and AFOSR. At CMU, I received the College of Engineering Philip and Marsha Dowd Fellowship in 2023, and held the inaugural Robert E. Doherty Career Development Professorship during 2018-2020.

<p>I am an IEEE Fellow (Class of 2023) for contributions to statistical signal processing with low-dimensional structures. I also had the privilege to deliver plenary, keynote and tutorial talks at several conferences and workshops, with more materials shared <a href="talks.html">here</a>. I was named the <a href="https://www.itsoc.org/honors/goldsmith-lecture">Goldsmith Lecturer</a> by IEEE Information Theory Society in 2021, a <a href="https://signalprocessingsociety.org/professional-development/past-lecturers">Distinguished Lecturer</a> by IEEE Signal Processing Society for 2022-2023, and a <a href="https://speakers.acm.org/speakers/chi_18749">Distinguished Speaker</a> by ACM for 2023-2026.

<p>Previously I was with the Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Dept. of  Biomedical Informatics at The Ohio State University until 2017. I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2012, where I was fortunate and grateful to be advised by <a href="http://ece.duke.edu/faculty/robert-calderbank">Prof. Robert Calderbank</a>. I received a M.A. in Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2009, and a B.Eng. in Electronic Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2007. 

<p>I have an Erdos number of 3.</p>
 
<p><b>To prospective students:</b> I have openings in my group to work on both theory and applications for generative AI and data science. However, I may not be able to respond to all inquiries due to bandwidth and fit. </p>
